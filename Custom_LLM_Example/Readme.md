# Advanced AI for Scientific Paper Generation and Custom Language Models

This repository contains two main projects:

1. CustomPaperPipeline: An advanced AI system for generating scientific papers
2. CustomLLM: A custom implementation of a Language Model

## CustomPaperPipeline

CustomPaperPipeline is a cutting-edge AI pipeline that pushes the boundaries of automated scientific paper generation. This innovative system combines advanced machine learning techniques with natural language processing to create a powerful tool for researchers and academics.

### Features

- Data Collection: Fetches relevant scientific papers from arXiv
- Preprocessing: Cleans and structures raw text data
- Custom Transformer Model: Tailored for scientific writing
- Adaptive Surrogate Ensemble (ASE): Optimizes paper generation parameters
- Paper Generation: Creates new scientific papers based on prompts
- Refinement: Optional refinement using OpenAI's GPT model

### Key Components

- Custom Transformer Encoder
- Adaptive Tokenization
- Dynamic Mask Handling
- Flexible Paper Structure

### Usage

```python
from custom_paper_pipeline import CustomPaperPipeline

pipeline = CustomPaperPipeline(vocab_size, hidden_size, num_layers, num_heads, dropout)
paper = pipeline.run_full_pipeline('machine learning in healthcare', num_papers=10000, train_epochs=10)
```

## CustomLLM

CustomLLM is a custom implementation of a Language Model, designed to showcase the inner workings of language models and provide a foundation for experimentation and learning.

### Features

- Custom tokenizer implementation
- Transformer-based architecture
- Training and inference capabilities
- Customizable model parameters

### Usage

```python
from custom_llm import CustomLLM

model = CustomLLM(vocab_size, d_model, nhead, num_layers)
model.train(train_data, num_epochs)
generated_text = model.generate("Your prompt here", max_length=100)
```
