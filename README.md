# Adaptive Surrogate Ensemble Optimization for Hyperparameter Tuning

## Overview

This repository contains the code and paper for "Adaptive Surrogate Ensemble Optimization for Hyperparameter Tuning: A Comparative Analysis with Random Search" by Nigel van der Laan.

### Abstract

Hyperparameter optimization remains a critical challenge in machine learning, directly impacting model performance and generalizability. This study introduces the Adaptive Surrogate Ensemble (ASE) method for hyperparameter optimization and presents a comprehensive comparison with Random Search (RS). We evaluate these methods on the Digits and Breast Cancer datasets, analyzing their performance across multiple iterations. Our results demonstrate that ASE consistently outperforms RS in terms of stability and convergence speed, with a 15% improvement in average accuracy and a 30% reduction in performance variance.

## Key Features

- Implementation of the Adaptive Surrogate Ensemble (ASE) method
- Comparison with Random Search
- Evaluation on multiple datasets (Digits, Breast Cancer)
- Comprehensive analysis and visualization of results

## Installation

To set up the project environment:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ase-hyperparameter-optimization.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd ase-hyperparameter-optimization
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the experiments:

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook ASE_paper_draft.ipynb
   ```
2. Execute the cells in the notebook to reproduce the experiments and results.

## Results

Our experiments show that ASE consistently outperforms Random Search in terms of:
- Stability of hyperparameter configurations
- Convergence speed
- Average accuracy across iterations

Detailed results and visualizations can be found in the notebook and the paper.
